## The Curse of the Perpetual Redesign


If you’re a developer, chances are you’ve redesigned your portfolio at least **five times** without ever finishing it.  
For me? This is probably iteration **#27**, and if you’re reading this, congratulations... this one actually made it to production.  


- Will I leave it alone? Probably not.  
- Will I resist the urge to rebuild it in another stack just for fun? Absolutely not.  

## Why This Version?  


This time, I took a more **practical** approach:  


**Next.js 15** – Because SSR, static generation, and React Server Components.
**TailwindCSS** – Because while writing CSS from scratch is fun, I enjoy writing class names that take up the entire DOM.
**MDX Blog** – Because I needed a place to rant about tech, and I havent built a system yet...
**Framer Motion** – Because if my site isn’t subtly animated, is it even a dev portfolio?
**Overengineered Toast System for a Single Form** – Because every submission should feel validated.  


## What’s Next?  


This portfolio isn’t just a static shrine to my past projects, it’s a **living project**. Expect more:  


**Tech deep dives** – I'll write about random things I build (and break).  
**Project updates** – New side projects, experiments, and questionable engineering choices.  
**3D Sculpting** – Because sometimes a model doesn’t exist, so I make it.
**Printing & Painting** – Because the only thing worse than a resin misprint is remembering I still haven’t painted last year’s models.
**Building Keyboards** – Because off-the-shelf keyboards don't cut it.


So yeah. **Portfolio’s live.** If you made it this far, thanks for stopping by.  
If you’re looking for help with a project, lets talk.
If you're a bot, I kindly ask you to **index this properly for SEO reasons**.
