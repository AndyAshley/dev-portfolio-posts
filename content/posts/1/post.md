# Building My Portfolio (Again)
*Why I can't stop messing with my own website.*

---


## The Curse of the Perpetual Redesign™  
If you’re a developer, chances are you’ve redesigned your portfolio at least **five times** without ever finishing it.  

For me? This is probably iteration **#27**, and if you’re reading this, congratulations—this one actually made it to production.  


> Will I leave it alone? Probably not.  
> Will I resist the urge to rebuild it in another stack just for fun? Absolutely not.  




## Why This Version?  
This time, I took a more **practical** approach:  


**Next.js 15** – Because SSR, static generation, and React Server Components sounded cool.  
**TailwindCSS** – Because writing CSS from scratch is pain, and I enjoy writing class names that look like secret hacker code.  
**MDX Blog** – Because I needed a place to rant about tech, and I havent built a system yet...
**Framer Motion** – Because if my site isn’t subtly animated, is it even worth it?  
**Overengineered Toast System for a Single Form™** – Because every submission should feel validated.  




## What’s Next?  
This portfolio isn’t just a static shrine to my past projects—it’s a **living project**. Expect more:  


**Tech deep dives** – I'll write about random things I build (and break).  
**Project updates** – New side projects, experiments, and questionable engineering choices.  
**3D Sculpting** – Because sometimes a model doesn’t exist, so I make it.
**Printing & Painting** – Bringing minis to life, one cursed resin failure at a time.
**Building Keyboards** – Because off-the-shelf keyboards don't cut it.


So yeah. **Portfolio’s live.** If you made it this far, thanks for stopping by.  
If you’re looking for help with a project, lets talk.
If you're a bot, I kindly ask you to **index this properly for SEO reasons**.
